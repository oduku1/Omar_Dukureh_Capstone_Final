# Project Overview
## Problem Area:
My area of interest is sports analytics, especially within the realm of basketball. One major challenge in this field is estimating how well a player will perform across an entire season. Traditional stats like points per game and field goal percentage are helpful but don't always give a full picture when projecting long-term outcomes. My project will aim to predict player win shares, which is a more comprehensive measure of a player's contribution to their team's success.

## Affected Stakeholders 
This project will benefit NBA teams, analysts, bettors, and users of fantasy basketball software. Teams can use these long-term projections to plan trades, rotations, and development strategies. Fantasy basketball players and sports bettors can gain an edge by anticipating breakout seasons or underperforming players. Analysts can use these models to explore broader trends and player trajectories.

## Proposed Data Science Approach:
Machine learning can significantly improve long-term performance prediction by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that may not be obvious to human analysts. I plan to use regression models to forecast season stats such as points, assists, and rebounds based on prior season performances. I will try to complete this using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm that deals with much more complex relationships. Unlike linear regression, its uses decision tree based learning and goes through every tree fixing the mistakes of the last. While similar models exist, many lack depth in statistical modeling and data handling and are not as fast as XGBoost.  

## The Impact:
The impact of this project will be significant. Teams can use these predictions to make informed decisions about player trades, rotations, and development strategies. Fantasy basketball players and sports bettors can gain an edge by anticipating breakout seasons or underperforming players. Analysts can use these models to explore broader trends and player trajectories.

# Dataset Description
 The dataset that I used for this is the NBA player Stats dataset from Basketball Reference, This includes data from the 2018-2019 NBA season to the 2024-2025 NBA season.
 The data includes player statistics such as points, rebounds, assists, and minutes played.
